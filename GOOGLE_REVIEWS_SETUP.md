## üîß Quick Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Google Places API Key

2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the "Places API" 
4. Go to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "API Key"
5. Copy your API key

### Step 2: Find Your Google Place ID

You have a direct review link: https://g.page/r/Ccotkqk7ORnPEAE/review

To get your Place ID for the API:
1. Go to [Place ID Finder](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id-finder)
2. Search for "TP Health and Fitness" or use your business address
3. Copy the Place ID (starts with "ChIJ...")

**Alternative**: You can also extract it from your Google Business Manager or use the URL above to find your listing.

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Google Places API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID=your_place_id_here
```

### Step 4: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üìã Important Notes

### API Limitations
- **Free Tier**: 17,000 requests per month
- **Review Limit**: Only shows 5 most recent reviews (Google limitation)
- **Cost**: $0.017 per request after free tier

### Fallback Behavior
- If API is not configured, shows placeholder reviews
- If API fails, shows cached fallback reviews
- No errors will break your site
